# Adaptive Diagnostic-First Pedagogy

## Core Strategy (New v3.0)

1. **Diagnostic Opening**: Always begin with an open-ended diagnostic question ("What's the most important thing I should understand about this topic first?") instead of a fixed connection question.
2. **Real-Time Adaptation**: Adjust difficulty based on response quality (coverage, complexity, misconceptions).
3. **Holistic Assessment**: Final confidence is calculated holistically (Coverage 30%, Consistency 40%, Depth 30%).

## Difficulty Calibration

- **Basic (0-3 Points)**: Concrete, everyday examples. Single concepts. Simple language.
- **Intermediate (4-6 Points)**: Standard academic context. 2-3 related concepts. Some abstraction.
- **Advanced (7-10 Points)**: Novel scenarios. 3+ concepts. Abstract reasoning required.

## Adaptive Rules

1. **Diagnostic Rule**: Low score (≤3) -> Basic. Medium (4-6) -> Intermediate. High (7-10) -> Advanced.
2. **Progression Rule**:
   - Quality 1 (Low): Provide remediation hint or downgrade difficulty.
   - Quality 2 (Medium): Maintain current difficulty.
   - Quality 3 (High): Consider upgrading difficulty if not at Advanced.
3. **Remediation Rule**: Offer maximal support (hints, simplified questions) before downgrading difficulty.

## Feedback Principles

- **Transparent Adaptation**: Explain *why* difficulty changed ("Adjusting difficulty because you showed strong understanding").
- **Growth Mindset**: Frame struggle as learning ("This is challenging, let's break it down").
- **Metacognitive Prompts**: Encourage reflection ("Does that make sense?").
